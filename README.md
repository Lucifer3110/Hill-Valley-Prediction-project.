# Hill-Valley-Prediction-project.
In the realm of predictive analysis for Hill Valley, logistic regression is a statistical technique employed to forecast binary outcomes related to various factors in the region



**Data Set :**  https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/blob/main/Hill%20Valley%20Dataset.csv 

Data information : Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y coordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a "bump" in the terrain) or a Valley (a "dip" in the terrain). See the original source for some examples of these graphs

1-100 Labeled "Vaa Floating point values (numeric), the X-values

101: Labeled "Class". Binary (0, 1) representing (valley, hill)

using this data set we can predict the Hill and Valley using Logistic Regression
